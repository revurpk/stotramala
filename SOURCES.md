## 1. Śrī Durgā Saptaślokī

### 1.1 The work

The Saptaślokī ("seven verses") is a short devotional selection drawn
from the **Durgā Saptaśatī** (*Devī Māhātmya*), itself a section of the
**Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa**. The composition is ancient and in the **public
domain**. It circulates with a traditional frame — a question by Śiva,
the Devī's reply — and a *viniyoga* naming Nārāyaṇa as ṛṣi, anuṣṭubh as
the metre, and Mahākālī, Mahālakṣmī and Mahāsarasvatī as the deities.

### 1.2 Electronic transcription

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Origin | `https://shlokam.org/shloka/sri-durga-sapta-shloki.htm` |
| Recorded | 2026-07-23 |
| Obtained via | Maintainer's local note file (`Sri Sapta Shloki Durga.md`) |
| Stated license | **None stated on the page** |
| Used for | Romanized Sanskrit text only |

**Licensing analysis.** The underlying verses are public domain by age.
The site publishes a romanized transcription but asserts no explicit
licence, and offers no statement about reuse. Per the sourcing rule in
`README.md` §5, this doubt is recorded rather than ignored:

> **Unresolved.** A bare transcription of a public-domain text into
> Roman script is unlikely to attract fresh copyright in most
> jurisdictions (it is a mechanical rendering, not an original work).
> That reasoning is *not* a substitute for permission. **Commercial
> redistribution of this stotra is blocked** until either (a) the text
> is re-keyed against a public-domain print edition of the Durgā
> Saptaśatī, or (b) explicit permission is obtained. Non-commercial
> personal use is unaffected.

The English translations and all editorial matter are **original work by
the maintainer**, not derived from the source page, and are released
under CC BY 4.0.

### 1.3 Corrections applied to both editions

Typographic damage in the received transcription. Both are artifacts of
an ITRANS-style scheme in which capital `C` encodes छ, surviving into
display text where it reads as a stray capital.

| # | Received | Corrected | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `anuṣṭup Chandaḥ` | `anuṣṭup chandaḥ` | छन्दः — stray capital mid-phrase; छ is `ch` in IAST |
| 2 | `prayachChati` | `prayacchati` | प्रयच्छति — stray capital mid-word; च्छ is `cch` in IAST |

### 1.4 Normalization applied to the `-iast` edition only

The source romanization is **not strict IAST**: it marks `ē`/`ō` (an
ISO 15919 / South-Indian convention; in Sanskrit *e* and *o* are always
long and take no macron) and writes च as `ch` (IAST reserves `ch` for
छ). The `-iast` edition normalizes this. The `-original` edition
preserves the source reading.

| # | Class | Source | Strict IAST | Instances |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Vowel | `ē` | `e` | *dēvī → devī*, *durgē → durge*, *tē → te*, … |
| 2 | Vowel | `ō` | `o` | *mōhāya → mohāya*, *namō'stu → namo'stu*, … |
| 3 | Consonant | `ch` (= च) | `c` | *chētāṃsi → cetāṃsi*, *sadārdrachittā → sadārdracittā* |
| 4 | Consonant | `ḻ` (= ळ) | `ḷ` | *mahākāḻī → mahākāḷī*, *maṅgaḻa → maṅgaḷa* |
| 5 | Punctuation | `।` `॥` | `\|` `\|\|` | daṇḍa and double daṇḍa, incl. verse numbers |

Note that `uvāca` was already strict IAST in the source and is
unchanged.

### 1.5 Editorial emendation, `-iast` edition

| # | Received | Emended | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gaurī` (v. 3) | `gauri` | Vocative singular of *gaurī* is **short** *-i* (Pāṇini 7.3.107, *ambārthanadyor hrasvaḥ*). The verse addresses the Goddess in a string of vocatives — *śaraṇye tryambake gauri nārāyaṇi* — where every neighbour is correctly short. The source's long *ī* is a nominative form in a vocative slot. |

Applied at the maintainer's direction. The `-original` edition retains
`gaurī` as received.

### 1.6 The ॐ glyph

The `-iast` edition opens with the Devanagari **ॐ** rather than a
romanized *oṃ*, at the maintainer's direction: it functions as a sacred
emblem rather than as running text. It is the only Devanagari character
in that file and relies on the platform's own Devanagari font, so the
file remains free of external dependencies.

---

## 2. Fonts

None bundled. All files use a system serif stack (Iowan Old Style,
Palatino Linotype, Palatino, Book Antiqua, Georgia, Times New Roman)
with a generic `serif` fallback, and — where Devanagari appears — the
platform's default Devanagari face. **No font files are redistributed
and no web fonts are fetched.**

## 3. Third-party code

None. No libraries, frameworks, or scripts of any kind are used.
